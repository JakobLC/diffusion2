```
conda create -n diff-env python=3.8.12
conda activate diff-env
conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio pytorch-cuda=12.1 -c pytorch -c nvidia
conda install -n diff-env -c conda-forge --file requirements.txt
pip install git+https://github.com/JakobLC/jlc.git --no-deps
pip install -U git+https://github.com/lilohuang/PyTurboJPEG.git
pip install git+https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything.git
